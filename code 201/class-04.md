HTML Links, JS Functions, and Intro to CSS Layout
Links
Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another — enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing.Links are created using the (a) element, Users can click on anything between the opening (a) tag and the closing (/a) tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

## links types :

Links from one website to another.
Links from one page to another on the same website.
Links from one part of a web page to another part of the same page.
Links that open in a new browser window.
Links that start up your email program and address a new email to someone.
Lyout
In layout we learn how to control where each element sits on a page and how to create attractive page layouts. Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window, Measurements tend to be given in pixels,To create a fixed width layout,the width of the main boxes ona page will usually be specifiedin pixels (and sometimes their height, too).Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window,They tend to use percentages to specify the width of each box so that the design will stretch to fit the size of the screen.

(div) elements are often used as containing elements to group together sections of a page.
Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.

Functions, Methods, and Objects
Function
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of statements). Functions consist of a series of statements that have been grouped to together because they perform a specific task. Expressions produce a value. They can be used where values are expected.If a function is placed where a browser expects to see an expression,(e.g., as an argument to a function), then it gets treated as an expression. A function declaration creates a function that you can call later in your code. It is the type of function you have seen so far in this book.If you put a function where the interpreter would expect to see an expression, then it is treated as an expression, and it is known as a function expression. In function expressions, the name is usually omitted.

Pair programming
pair programming commonly involves two roles: the (Driver) and the (Navigator). The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.

6 Reasons for Pair Programming:
Greater efficiency
Engaged collaboration
Learning from fellow students
Social skills
Job interview readiness
Work environment readiness
